# Scenario

I am a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, I recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

I am tasked with completing a vulnerability assessment of the situation to communicate the potential risks to decision makers at the company. I must create a written report that explains how the vulnerable server is a risk to business operations and how it can be secured.

# Step-By-Step Instructions

## Part 1 - Open a report template

### Step 1: Access supporting material

Link to supporting material: <a href="NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1.pdf">NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1</a>

### Step 2: Review information about vulnerable server

Read and review the System Description and Scope provided. The System Description highlights the relevant components, architecture, and dependencies of the system being assessed. All of these parts and connections make up the attack surface of the vulnerable information system. The Scope specifies the focus and boundaries of the assessment. For example, you might specify that the scope of this assessment only relates to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data on the server — not the physical security of the server or its related IT systems.


## Part 2 - Perform the risk assessment

### Step 1: Explain the purpose of the information system

Write  a purpose statement. The purpose section helps stakeholders understand the underlying objective and intended outcome of the analysis. A purpose statement also connects the technical objectives of the analysis with the organization's goals.
Consider the following about the server:
- How is the database server valuable to the business?
- Why is it important for the business to secure the data on the server?
- How might the server impact the business if it were disabled?
- In the Purpose section of the report, use the questions provided and write 3-5 sentences (60-100 words) describing the reason(s) for conducting this vulnerability analysis.

### Step 2: Identify potential threat sources

With the knowledge about the vulnerable database server, notice the threat types and examples described. In the Threat Source column of the Risk Assessment table, identify three potential threats. Choose the threats based on the information gathered from the system description, scope, purpose, and NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 resource.

### Step 3: Identify potential threat events

Explore the Threat events section in the resource. Then, identify three threat events that could be initiated based on the threat sources identified. Write the three threat events in the Threat Event column of the Risk Assessment table.

### Step 4: Calculate the risk of potential threats

Calculating risks that potential threats and vulnerabilities are important factors to think about when evaluating the security of an asset. Refer to the likelihood and severity sections of the NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 resource and askthe following questions about each threat identified earlier:
- How frequently could this happen?
- Would critical business functions be impacted?
- How might this affect the business and its customers?
  
Then, estimate a Likelihood score (1-3) and Severity score (1-3) for each threat and add the scores to the corresponding columns of the Risk Assessment table. After that, calculate an overall Risk score (1-9) for each threat using the formula (likelihood x severity = risk).


## Part 3 - Propose security recommendations

### Step 1: Explain approach

A qualitative vulnerability assessment relies on subjective judgment to assess the likelihood and severity of risks. Estimate how bad attacks could be by judging their chances based on security knowledge. Qualitative vulnerability assessments are useful for identifying high-level risks facing an organization. This information helps organizations make informed decisions about resource allocation, project planning, and other aspects of their business operations.

Write 3-5 sentences (60-100 words) in the Approach section to explain the 3 specific threat sources/events selected and why they're significant business risks.

### Step 2: Propose a remediation strategy

After performing a vulnerability assessment, creating a well-defined remediation strategy is crucial for protecting systems and data.  The remediation strategy should provide stakeholders with actionable steps that can be taken to remediate, or fix, vulnerabilities to avoid threats.

Note: Certain threats cannot be fixed. In those cases, it's equally important to consider a mitigation strategy — a plan to reduce the severity of a threat.

Think about the risks that could remediate and/or mitigate using security controls like:
- Principle of least privilege 
- Defense in depth
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Authentication, Authorization, Accounting (AAA) framework

In the Remediation section, write 3-5 sentences (60-100 words) summarizing specific security controls that could be implemented to remediate or mitigate the risks to the information system. Align suggestions with the risks assessed.
