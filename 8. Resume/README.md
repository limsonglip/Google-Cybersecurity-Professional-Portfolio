# Scenario

My resume gives potential employers a first impression of me and my qualifications. To prepare for my search for roles in cybersecurity, I will need to create a new resume or update my current one to reflect the skills and experiences I have gained from this program. First, I will search for and identify a target role. Then, as I craft my resume, I will tailor the content to match the requirements for that role.

# Step-By-Step Instructions

## Step 1: Research cybersecurity roles

Think about what about all cybersecurity roles learned in this program so far, and decide which type of role is most interesting. Consider the tasks and responsibilities, current skill set, and previous experience. Then, research roles on platforms like Indeed, LinkedIn™ Job Search, and/or CareerBuilder, and identify a position that stands out.

## Step 2: Take research notes

Add a blank page to the bottom of the resume document, or open a new document to take notes on findings. Then, record the job title of the selected role, as well as some of the qualifications and skills required for that position. Read several additional job descriptions for similar roles to identify qualifications and skills that show up frequently, and note those as well.

## Step 3: Add contact information

In the resume, add contact information at the top of the document. Include the following information:
- Name
- Location (such as city and state)
- Phone number
- Email address
- (Optional) the URL to your LinkedIn profile

Next, add a job title near the contact information that conveys both the current experience and the role sought. For example, add “Incident Response Analyst”, “Data Forensics Analyst”, or something more broad, such as “Cybersecurity Analyst.”

## Step 4: Add skills

Review the notes in Step 2 to fill in the Skills section of the resume. Include skills that align closely with the requirements for the position identified. These might include skills learned in this program or ones gained in previous positions, such as:
- Python and data logging 
- Communicating with stakeholders
- Attention to detail

To organize this section, format the skills as a bulleted list in two or more columns and split different types of skills into different sections, based on the requirements of the role.

## Step 5: Add experience

The Experience section provides a summary of the positions held thus far. This can include volunteer roles and other relevant experience. Each listing should include:
- Company name
- Location
- Job title
- Dates you worked there. (If you are still working there, write your start date, a hyphen, and then “Present.”)
- A short description or bulleted list of your responsibilities 

Focus on showcasing only the best and most relevant responsibilities or accomplishments. The resume doesn’t need to include every detail from every job held. Go into more details during the interview.

Follow these best practices when adding to the Experience descriptions:
- Use active verbs like developed, coordinated, created, planned, built, tracked, managed, and monitored to describe the tasks performed. 
- When possible, quantify the tasks performed by including numbers. (For example, “Collaborate with over 10 departments to ensure synchronization across the organization.”)
- Write in the present tense for current work, and use the past tense for a job or project that have been completed. 
- Aim to communicate how skills and past accomplishments relate to the current role.

## Step 6: Add education

The Education section describes any formal schooling and training. Listing the education history helps demonstrate the qualifications and knowledge to a potential employer and shows that requirements are met for the opportunity sought. 

Fill in the name of any school attended after high school; its location; the degree, diploma, or certificate earned; and the dates attended. Begin with the most recent school first. Also, include any internships, apprenticeships, professional certifications, or credentials. 

## Step 7: Add what a personal touch

Complete the resume with a section that further stands out to potential employers. There are many approaches to communicating what makes a person unique from other applicants. For example, the Awards section can be used to list any awards received. Include who awarded them, and the date they were received. Alternatively, replace this section with a section like “Languages,” “Software,” “Volunteer Work,” “Projects,” “Hobbies and Interests,” or “Accomplishments.”

## Step 8: Proofread resume

It's critical to carefully proofread the resume for spelling, grammatical, and punctuation errors. Correcting any mistakes demonstrates attention to detail. Make sure the resume is as concise as possible. Ideally, the length of the resume should be no more than one or two pages, particularly early on in the career. Choose a more precise word or concise phrasing.
